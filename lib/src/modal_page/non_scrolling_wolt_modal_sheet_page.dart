/// A [NonScrollingWoltModalSheetPage] is a specialized page for the [WoltModalSheet]
/// that is designed to display content which is flexible in height but unlikely
/// to require scrolling.
///
/// This class is designed for content that needs to adapt to the available
/// vertical space within the modal sheet's maximum height, but is unlikely
/// to exceed that height and require scrolling. It is ideal for content that
/// is flexible in height but has fixed (or intrinsic) dimensions and is laid
/// out using the [Flex] layout model of a [Column].
///
/// Warning:
/// - If there is a risk that the content's height might exceed the modal
///   sheet's maximum height, leading to overflow, it is recommended to use
///   [SliverWoltModalSheetPage] or [WoltModalSheetPage] instead. These classes
///   provide scrolling capabilities to handle larger content effectively using slivers.
